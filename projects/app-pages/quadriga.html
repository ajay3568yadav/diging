                <p>Citesphere is a web application that can link to Zotero and allows you to manage your Zotero citations. You can add additional information to the citations that Zotero doesn't support such as specifying author affiliations or author URIs.</p>

                    <p>If you have a way of importing references into Zotero, you can use your local Zotero client to collect references. Make sure that the references that you want to manage in Citesphere are in a Zotero group (the group does not have to be shared) and that the group is synced.</p>
