On Monday, March 22, 2021, 1-2pm MST, research software engineers from various parts of ASU (Research Computing, School of Complex Adaptive Systems, the Library, and others) will hold a Code and Coffee session for anyone who needs help with a coding-related problem or who just wants to chat about technology.
Are you stuck with your Python script?
Do you need help with your web application? 
Are you yelling at your computer because your R script isn’t doing what you want? 
We might be able to help! And if not, we can maybe point you in the right direction or  connect you with someone who can help.

It doesn’t matter how much experience you have! Just starting out? 
We’ll hold your hand. You know how to code, but want some architectural advice? 
Come on in. You’re an expert and really want to chat about that one feature in Python? We’re happy to!

Join us on Zoom and bring a coffee (or tea, or water, whatever you prefer): https://asu.zoom.us/j/82162770292?pwd=a002azlaWmtyY2VsZ1FPdiszaUZNdz09
